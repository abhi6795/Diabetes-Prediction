# Diabetes-Prediction
One of the most prevalent diseases in the world, diabetes has an increasing prevalence throughout time. Although the primary cause of diabetes is still unknown, scientists think that both hereditary and environmental lifestyle factors play a significant influence in the disease.

Research on the Pima tribe, an American tribe, was conducted a few years ago . It was discovered that the women of this tribe get diabetes quite early. These instances were chosen from a bigger database under a number of restrictions. To be specific, all patients were Pima Native women who were at least 21 years old.

The attributes in the dataset are:
Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration over 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
DiabetesPedigreeFunction: A function which scores likelihood of diabetes based on family history.
Age: Age in years

Outcome : Class variable (0: person is not diabetic or 1: person is diabetic)

Here, we are performing exploratory data analysis and developing a classification model to analyse several elements of diabetes in the Pima Indian tribe.
